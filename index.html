    Hi! My name is Charlie May, I recently graduated from SUNY Fredonia in May 2020 with a Bachelors of science in Computer Science.  I am currently working at SymLink as a bench tech, and learning how to use Wordpress better to do web development for them.

    <br>
    QandMcontracting.com is the first website that I developed.  I made the first version in my Software Engineering class as my final project in order to learn HTML,    CSS, and JavaScript because I had never used them before that.  This website sparked my interest in web-dev because multiple customers reached out to my dad and told them that they were impressed by it.  After I realized that the website had this traffic, I decided to look into different CMS's and decided to use WIX to redesign it to make it feel more professional.

      	While working at Q&M doing construction for my father I met Meaghan and she asked me if I could make a website for her.  I used this project as a learning oppertunity in order to work hand in hand with the owner and to be able to deliver the website that the customer wants.  I provided a template on google docs for Meaghan to fill out as we worked together on google docs, and we communicated through that throughout the whole process.  I decided to use WIX because she would be able to manage it on her own after I made the first iteration for her.

      	Karin's Healing Light is the first website that I made with WIX.  Karin is my friend Andrew's mother and she bought a WIX package to start making the website on her own.  She ran into alot of obsticals and eventually reached out to me to help her make the website.  I used this project as a way to learn WIX and this is where I realized that I really enjoyed web development and wanted to start looking for more projects in the field.

    Symlink is the company I currently work for.  When I started working for them they wanted to see what I could do in WordPress never using it before.  I did some research and ended up using Elementor as my page builder, deleted all of the content on the pages(astra as my theme) and started from scratch in order to learn all of the ins/outs of Elementor.

      <body><br>
      	The owner of SymLink is Jason Spain, he is also a GM at a ski-resort called Cockaigne.  They had an old website that didn't function properly so I made them a new one in a sand-box with all of the content from the original, then presented it to him to see if he wanted to work with it.  He really liked the new website and decided to work with me.  From there he would send me emails of content to add and when I created the new page or updated the info we would call over zoom and make final tweeks together.
